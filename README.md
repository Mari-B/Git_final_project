# Git_final_project
A blog web application that I created as final project of Sky Get into Tech Programme.

This web app was created with Python using Flask, Jinja, HTML, CSS, JavaScript as well as MySQL.

The demo here below only shows the look of the website and some basic feautures, however it's also possible to:
- register
- login
- leave comments
- create, edit and delete posts (CRUD)
- like posts
- query the database to view the most liked, most recent posts.
